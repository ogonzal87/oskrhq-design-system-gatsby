# **OSKRHQ.DS Website**
This is a website made to showcase a [Design System](https://github.com/ogonzal87/oskrhq-design-system) I created from scratch. The system was created for both Designers and Developers. It makes use of a CSS architecture based on a shared anatomy (Color, Typography, Space, Depth, and Motion), and a variety of React Presentational Components built from this shared anatomy. The system also has a UI Kit with available Sketch Symbols matching these React Components so Designers and Developers are always in sync. 🤙🏽 

# **Usage**
Head to the Design System's repo [here](https://github.com/ogonzal87/oskrhq-design-system).

#### **Are you a Designer?**
You are not lost, feel free to dig through the code but you will be more interested in the UI Kit which mirrors this repo code. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ogonzal87/oskrhq-uikit).

### Why should I use a Design System?
If you are here, you already know why. 🤓

### What if the element/component I need is not in the UI Kit?
You can create your own components using the base Anatomy which provides some really useful utility sass functions, mixins and classes.
