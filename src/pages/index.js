            <p>OSKRHQ.DS is a Styleguide AND a Component Library written in React for both web and mobile. Although this website consumes the system, the site of is just a face for what it really is. The magic is in the code which allows Design and Code to coexists in one sole visual language. All this, so that product teams can compose many products from the same Brand Identity or UI Anatomy.</p>

            <p>Every UI element you see here was composed from the same 5 foundational elements or what I call <a href="https://medium.muz.li/the-anatomy-of-all-digital-interfaces-11d43f55eaf" target="_blank">The Anatomy of UI</a>; Color, Typography, Space, Motion, and Depth</p>

            <p>Every interface you interact with was designed at some point. And those interfaces were probably crafted by design teams divided into smaller teams. These silos create fragmented experiences looking at the product holistically. Coupled with headaches when trying to communicate designs to developers, it can get really ugly for the user since their experience is the interaction with the whole product, not just a specific part of it.</p>

            <p>If you are a Designer... I got you. I created a <a href="https://github.com/ogonzal87/oskrhq-uikit" target="blank">UI Kit</a> that mirrors the components you see in this website. That way, you can create experiences with the same building blocks (components) the Developers have. It also has all the design assets you will need to get started.</p>
