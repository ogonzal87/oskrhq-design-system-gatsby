            <p>OSKRHQ.DS is a Styleguide AND a Component Library written in React for both web and mobile. Although this website consumes the system, the site of is just a face for what it really is. The magic is in the code and how Design and Code are able to coexists in one sole language, allowing teams to compose many products from the same Brand Identity.</p>

            <p>Every UI element you see here was composed from the same 5 foundational elements or what I call <a href="https://medium.muz.li/the-anatomy-of-all-digital-interfaces-11d43f55eaf" target="_blank">The Anatomy of UI</a>; Color, Typography, Space, Motion, and Depth</p>

            <p>Everything you see was designed at some point. However, as Brian Reed would say, few things are designed well. In most companies, interfaces are crafted in silos by smaller teams. This isolation creates fragmented experiences in the form of inconsistencies looking at the product holistically. Coupled with headaches when trying to communicate designs to developers, it can get really ugly for the user since their experience is the interaction with the whole product, not just a specific interface.</p>

            <p>If you are a Designer... I got you. I created a <a href="https://github.com/ogonzal87/oskrhq-uikit" target="blank">UI Kit</a> that mirrors the components you see in this website. That way, you can create experiences with the same building blocks (components) the Developers have. It also has all the design assets you will need to get started.</p>

            <p>If you are a Developer, check the <a href="https://github.com/ogonzal87/oskrhq-design-system-react" target="blank">Github repo</a> from guidance. And if you feel like contributing, it would make my day ðŸ˜Ž</p>
